  "body": "Introduction\r\n============\r\nimPROSE (integrated methods for prediction of super-enhancers) is a computational model to predict super-enhancers or constituents of super-enhancers from a list of candidate enhancers. imPROSE integrates diverse types of data including DNase I hypersensitivity (DNaseI), histone modifications (HMs), cofactors, transcription factors (TFs) and DNA sequence.\r\n\r\nimPROSE comes with six state-of-the-art machine learning models including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), AdaBoost (AB), Decision Tree (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB).\r\n\r\nRandom Forest is our optimal and default model but user can select any of the models and further test it using cross-validation, independent test data or use it to make predictions. \r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n-------------\r\nimPROSE requires:\r\n\r\n\t* Python (>= 2.6 or >= 3.3)\r\n\t* NumPy (>= 1.6.1): http://www.numpy.org/\r\n\t* SciPy (>= 0.9): http://www.scipy.org/\r\n\t* Scikit-learn (>= 0.17): http://scikit-learn.org/\r\n\t* Pandas (>= 0.16.0): http://pandas.pydata.org/\r\n\r\nIf you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy, the easiest way to install scikit-learn and pandas is using pip::\r\n\r\n\tpip install -U scikit-learn\r\n\r\n\tpip install -U pandas\r\n\r\nor using conda::\r\n\r\n\tconda install scikit-learn\r\n\r\n\tconda install pandas\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you donâ€™t already have a python installation with numpy, scipy and pandas, we recommend to install either via your package manager or via a python bundles (Canopy, Anaconda). These come with numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pandas and many other helpful scientific and data processing libraries and available for platforms including Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstall imPROSE\r\n---------------\r\nYou can install imPROSE either from PyPi using pip and install it from the source. Please make sure you have already installed the above mentioned python libraries required to run imPROSE.\r\n\r\nInstall from PyPi::\r\n\r\n\tpip install improse\r\n\r\nInstall from the source::\r\n\t\r\n\ttar -zxvf improse-1.0.tar.gz\r\n\tcd improse-1.0\r\n\tpython setup.py install\r\n\r\nHow to use Improse\r\n==================\r\nOnce you have installed imPROSE, you can type:\r\n\r\n\timprose --help\r\n\r\nto find the available commands and required parameters to run imPROSE. \r\n\r\nimPROSE demo\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nTo run a demo using Random Forest model and validate it using 10-fold cross-validation, you can type::\r\n\r\n\timprose --demo\r\n\r\nThis will save the results in the current working directory with a folder named ``Improse_results``. If you wish to save the results in a specific folder, you can type::\r\n\r\n\timprose --demo --output ~/path/to/your/folder\r\n\r\nSelect model\r\n------------\r\nimPROSE comes with six state-of-the-art machine learning models including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), AdaBoost (AB), Decision Tree (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB). Random Forest is the default model.\r\n\r\nTo select model you need to type::\r\n\r\n\timprose --model MODEL_NAME\r\n\r\nMODEL_NAME can be ``rf``, ``svm``, ``knn``, ``ab``, ``dt``, ``nb`` or use ``all`` if you want use all models one by one.\r\n\r\nDefine features and feature subsets\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nTo tell the model to use specific features you need to type::\r\n\r\n\timprose --model svm --feature H3K27ac,Brd4,p300,GC_Content\r\n\r\nMake sure the features names are comma separated. \r\n\r\nIf you want to compare the individual predictive power or combinatorial predictive power of different features, you need to pass the argument ``--compare`` with ``--features``::\r\n\r\n\timprose --model svm --feature H3K27ac,Brd4,p300,GC_content --compare\r\n\r\nTo check the combinatorial predictive power of features, you need to combine features with ``+`` symbol::\r\n\r\n\timprose --model svm --feature H3K27ac+Brd4,p300,GC_content+AT_content --compare\r\n\r\nHere model will test the combinatorial predictive power [H3K27ac,Brd4] and [GC_content,AT_content] along with p300.\r\n\r\nRun model with cross-validation\r\n-------------------------------\r\nBy default all models use 10-fold cross-validation. If you want to set different fold lets say 5, set ``--cv`` parameter as::\r\n\r\n\timprose --model rf --feature H3K27ac,Brd4,p300,GC_Content,AT_Content,phastCons --cv 5\r\n\r\nRun model with test data\r\n------------------------\r\nTo run the model with a test data you need the feature data saved a CSV file. Next, you need to tell the model, features you have to make prediction with using ``--feature`` and also provide the CSV file to '--input' and next type ``--test`` to tell model it is test datasets::\r\n\r\n\timprose --model rf --feature H3K27ac,Brd4,p300,pGC,pAT,phastCons --input ~/path/to/CSV/file.csv --test\r\n\r\nThis will generate an ROC plot and save the performance evaluations [precision, recall, f1-score, AUC, PRC] to ``Improse_tesults.txt``.\r\n\r\nMake predictions\r\n------------------\r\nTo make predictions should have computed available features and saved a CSV file. Next, you need to tell the model the features you have to make prediction with using ``--feature`` and also provide the CSV file to ``--input`` and next type ``--pred`` to make predictions::\r\n\r\n\timprose --model rf --feature H3K27ac,Brd4,p300,pGC,pAT,phastCons --input ~/path/to/CSV/file.csv --pred\r\n\r\nThis will save the predictions results as CSV file ``Improse_[MODEL_NAME]_predictions.csv``. In the CSV file the field Class is 1=SE and 0=TE. We also report  probability score for each prediction to tell the user how good and bad a prediction is. This will help to decide which candidates to select for further analysis.\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n========\r\nIf you have questions, or found any bug in the program, please write to us at ``khana10[at]mails.tsinghua.edu.cn``\r\n\r\nCite Us\r\n=========\r\nIf you use imPROSE please cite us: \r\n",
